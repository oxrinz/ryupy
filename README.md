# RyuPy

# Old c++ form of the project. Continuing dev in zig

## Ultra fast, specialized ML library

Inspired by the [scaling laws paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361), RyuPy is a machine learning library for the Turing microarchitecture (with others possibly coming in the future). This is a learning project

## Features
- No dependencies
- Custom cuda kernels
- Everything is written from scratch
- Optimized for specific use cases

# Built on NixOS <3
